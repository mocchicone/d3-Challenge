# D3 Scatterplot Graph 

The data set is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates: [https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml).  Using D3, JavaScrpit, CSS, and HTML created a scatterplot to explore the relationship between Poverty Rates and Healtcare Coverage at the state level. Based on the graph, it appears that there is a positive relationship between Poverty Rates and Lack of Healthcare Rates.  Further analysis using simple linear regression could be applied to confirm the significance of the relationship and understand the strenth of the relationship.
